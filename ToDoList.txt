Project To Do list:

1) Setup Stuff
  a) Define and read in parameters for the simulation                           <done for now, may need to add more>
  b) Create a Struct to represent the birds                                     <done>
  c) Create an array of birds to hold game state                                <done>
  d) Implement general simulator loop                                           <done>

2) Implement movement rules for birds:
  a) separation rule (avoid birds in close proximity)                           <not started>
  b) alignment rule (move in same direction as neighbors)                       <not started>
  c) cohesion rule (move towards the average position of neighbors)             <not started>

3) Implement collective MPI communication between each rank
  a) create MPI data type for sends and receives                                <done>
  b) collective call to pass data between ranks (likely MPI_Allgather)          <done (for printing)>

4) Implement pThreads within MPI ranks to calculate movements concurrently      <not started>

4) Implement function to output current state of the simulation                 <done, but may need to be modified based on step 5>

5) Create a visualization for the simulation (probably in Python or R)          <not started>

6) Design a test suite and write an sbatch file(s) for the BG/Q                 <not started>

7) Run the tests on the BG/Q                                                    <not started>

8) Write the report                                                             <not started>



Progress:
4/3  - Created github, simulator.c and simulator.h files
4/7  - Runs in serial with random moves
4/12 - Added support for multiple MPI ranks, continuous coordinates,
       and printing to CSV format, and removed negative coordinate bug

Next Steps:
- Program simulation rules
