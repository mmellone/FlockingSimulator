Project To Do list:

1) Setup Stuff
  a) Define and read in parameters for the simulation                           <done>
  b) Create a Struct to represent the birds                                     <done>
  c) Create an array of birds to hold game state                                <done>
  d) Implement general simulator loop                                           <done>

2) Implement movement rules for birds:
  a) separation rule (avoid birds in close proximity)                           <done, but need tuning>
  b) alignment rule (move in same direction as neighbors)                       <done, but need tuning>
  c) cohesion rule (move towards the average position of neighbors)             <done, but need tuning>

3) Implement collective MPI communication between each rank
  a) create MPI data type for sends and receives                                <done>
  b) collective call to pass data between ranks (likely MPI_Allgather)          <done>

4) Implement pThreads within MPI ranks to calculate movements concurrently      <done>

4) Implement function to output current state of the simulation                 <done>

5) Create a visualization for the simulation (probably in Python or R)          <done, but can be improved>

6) Use a cycle counter to analyze computation time vs. communication time	<not started>

6) Design a test suite and write an sbatch file(s) for the BG/Q                 <not started>

7) Run the tests on the BG/Q                                                    <not started>

8) Literature Review								<not started>

9) Write the report                                                             <not started>



Progress:
4/3  - Created github, simulator.c and simulator.h files
4/7  - Runs in serial with random moves
4/12 - Added support for multiple MPI ranks, continuous coordinates,
       and printing to CSV format, and removed negative coordinate bug
4/13 - Updated RNG to be dependent on rank number, implemented cohesion & alignment
     - Implemented MPI_Allgather to collect data from all ranks
     - need visualization to test correctness <done>
4/14 - Added simple visualization R script
     - Fixed bug where 'decide_next_move' was updating elements in 'all_birds' instead of 'birds'
     - A few other miscellaneous fixes
4/27 - Fixed directional rules, included normalization to equal effects of each rule
4/27 - Added support for pthreads ("-p <#threads>" in the run script)
     - Rules are implemented but need some tuning to work better
     - Fixed distance to account for wraparound
     - Removed excess space in plot
     
Next Steps:
- separate/smaller radius for separation
- Tune program simulation rules
- Start tests on the BG/Q

Current Bugs:
- some "missing values" in the R script
