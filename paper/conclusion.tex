We set out in this project with the goal of creating a high performance,
massively parallel simulation of flocking behavior in birds using an implicit
representation of the universe. We found that, through a strong scaling study,
this simulation scales well to many parallel processors, provided that a good
balance of MPI ranks and pthreads are used. In particular, MPI collective
operations scaled very well as the total number of compute nodes increased,
however, sending a large amount of small data packages does not appear to be
as efficient as sending larger packages of data between fewer ranks. A weak
scaling study showed that there is still much room for improvement in our update
algorithm in order to create better performance for very large numbers of birds.

The performance of the position update algorithm can be vastly improved by using
a better data structure than a simple array to hold the bird data types. In
particular we want a data structure that makes it easier to find birds that are
close together position-wise. This could be accomplished using a multidimensional
binary search tree, where it has been shown that regional searches can be done
in \(O(kN^{1-1/k})\) time \cite{Lee}. This would be a vast improvement over our
current \(O(n^2)\) search implementation.

Additionally we could also modify the MPI message passing to only send the
birds that are required by each MPI rank. Although the collective message passing
is quite efficient, as we continue to increase the number of simulated agents
it becomes impractical to keep a copy of every agent in each rank and perform a
large MPI\_Allgather each iteration.

While this simulation was specifically designed to imitate flocking birds, there
are many other applications that can make use of a efficient and highly scalable
simulator like this. For example, the emergent principles of flocking birds can
be applied to create dynamic visualizations of temporal data evolutions, such as
stock data \cite{Moere}. The simulation of the interactions between many agents
can even be used to select songs on an internet radio based on what other people
are currently listening to \cite{Ibáñez}.

There are many more uses for efficient simulations of emergent flocking behavior.
Our techniques of using an implicitly defined universe and combining
an optimal number of pthreads with MPI ranks provide a good base model that, if
combined with some more advanced data structures and smart message passing, can
be very effective for many of these uses.
