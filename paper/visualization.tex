In order to evaluate the correctness of our parallel algorithm, we
produced a real-time 3D visualization of the simulation's output data
using R. The simulation generates its own input (the initial locations
and headings of each bird) and provides several configuration
options. By default, each bird is positioned randomly throughout the
universe. However we also provide functionality for modeling distinct
clusters of birds in order to simulate interactions between flocks.
