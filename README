In order to compile the flocking simulator, simply use the command

> make all

This by default uses MPI_Wtime for timing. If running on the BG/Q,
simply add the flag "-D BGQ" to the Makefile and rebuild the
executable to enable the cycle counter.

The script "run" initializes and excutes the simulation. To run the
simulation with all default parameters, use the command

> ./run

To list all of the possible command-line arguments, use the command

> ./run -h

We've commented out the section of the script which creates
visualizations from the simulation output, since this requires a
working version of R and ImageMagick. In order to create flocking
visualizations, install these packages on your machine, uncomment this
section of the run script, and re-run the script.
